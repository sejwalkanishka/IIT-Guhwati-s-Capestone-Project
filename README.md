# Overview
Urban parking is a high-demand, limited resource. Static pricing causes overcrowding or underutilization.
This project simulates a real-time dynamic pricing system using occupancy, queue length, traffic, vehicle type, and competitor pricing.

# Tech Stack
* Python 3.10+
* Pandas, NumPy — for data processing
* Pathway — for real-time simulation
* Bokeh — for visualizations
* Google Colab — as the development environment
